## 🔍 Package Overview

Rejoice uses carefully selected packages for privacy, performance, and reliability. All processing happens locally on your device.

## 🐍 Core Python Dependencies

### 🎤 Audio Processing
```python

# Usage: Required by sounddevice for sample rate conversion
# Privacy: Mathematical library, no data collection
# Size: ~50MB, handles audio format conversions
```

### 🤖 AI Transcription
```python
openai-whisper>=20231117
# Local speech-to-text AI model (OpenAI's Whisper)
# Why: Best accuracy for offline transcription, runs locally
# Privacy: NO API calls to OpenAI - completely offline after download
# Models: Downloads 39MB-1.5GB models to your computer
# Security: Open source, auditable, runs in isolated environment
```

```python
torch>=2.0.0
# PyTorch machine learning framework (required by Whisper)
# Why: Whisper models run on PyTorch for AI inference
# Privacy: Local computation only, no telemetry
# Installation: Auto-installed as Whisper dependency (not in requirements.txt)
# Size: ~800MB-2GB depending on your system (CPU vs GPU)
# Note: Large but essential for AI model execution
```

### 🗂️ File Handling
```python
python-dotenv>=1.0.0
# Environment variable management for configuration
# Why: Secure storage of user settings in .env files
# Privacy: Local file storage, no external access

## 🤖 AI Models

### Whisper Models (Required)
Downloaded automatically during setup:

| Model  | Size    | RAM Usage | Accuracy | Use Case |
|--------|---------|-----------|----------|----------|
| tiny   | 39 MB   | ~390 MB   | Good     | Testing, low-resource systems |
| base   | 74 MB   | ~500 MB   | Better   | General use, older computers |
| small  | 244 MB  | ~1 GB     | Very Good| **Recommended default** |
| medium | 769 MB  | ~2 GB     | Excellent| Professional transcription |
| large  | 1550 MB | ~4 GB     | Best     | Critical accuracy needs |

**Storage location:** `~/.cache/whisper/` (can be deleted to free space)

### Ollama Models (Optional)
For AI-generated filenames and metadata:

| Model      | Size  | RAM Usage | Quality | Download Command |
|------------|-------|-----------|---------|------------------|
| gemma3:4b  | 2.5GB | ~3 GB     | Excellent | `ollama pull gemma3:4b` |
| llama3     | 4.7GB | ~5 GB     | Excellent | `ollama pull llama3` |
| qwen3:0.6b | 350MB | ~500 MB   | Good    | `ollama pull qwen3:0.6b` |
| phi3       | 2.3GB | ~3 GB     | Very Good | `ollama pull phi3` |

**Storage location:** `~/.ollama/models/` (managed by Ollama)

## 🔒 Security Information

### Privacy Guarantees
- ✅ **All audio processing on your device** - Whisper runs locally
- ✅ **No OpenAI API calls** - Uses downloaded models, not cloud services
- ✅ **No cloud AI services** - Ollama runs locally
- ✅ **No internet required** after initial setup
- ✅ **Zero telemetry** - No usage data collected
- ✅ **Zero external requests** (except to localhost Ollama)

### Network Activity Verification
The only network requests are to `localhost:11434` (local Ollama, if enabled):
```python
# From src/summarization_service.py
response = requests.get("http://localhost:11434/api/version", ...)  # Check if Ollama is running
response = requests.post("http://localhost:11434/api/generate", ...)  # Generate summaries/tags
```

You can verify this by:
1. **Reading the source code** - All network requests are visible and localhost-only
2. **Network monitoring** - Use tools like Little Snitch, Wireshark
3. **Offline testing** - Disconnect internet, transcription still works (AI features require Ollama)

### Package Security
- **All packages from PyPI** - Official Python package repository
- **Open source dependencies** - Code is auditable
- **No proprietary packages** - Everything can be inspected
- **Minimal dependencies** - Reduced attack surface

## 🗑️ Disk Space Usage

### Typical Installation
- **Python packages:** ~100MB
- **Whisper small model:** ~244MB  
- **Ollama + model:** ~2.5GB (optional)
- **System dependencies:** ~500MB
- **Total:** ~1GB (without Ollama) or ~3.5GB (with Ollama)

### Cleaning Up
```bash
# Remove Whisper model cache
rm -rf ~/.cache/whisper/

# Remove specific Ollama model  
ollama rm gemma3:4b

# Uninstall Python packages
pip uninstall -r requirements.txt

# Remove Homebrew audio (macOS)
brew uninstall portaudio
```

## 🚀 Performance Optimization

### For Lower RAM Usage
1. **Use smaller Whisper model:** `tiny` or `base`
2. **Use smaller Ollama model:** `qwen3:0.6b` 
3. **Reduce chunk duration:** Less buffering
4. **Fewer worker threads:** Lower parallel processing

### For Better Accuracy
1. **Use larger Whisper model:** `medium` or `large`
2. **More RAM:** Enables larger models
3. **Better microphone:** Hardware quality matters
4. **Quiet environment:** Reduce background noise

### For Faster Processing
1. **SSD storage:** Faster model loading
2. **More CPU cores:** Better parallel processing
3. **GPU acceleration:** PyTorch can use CUDA/Metal
4. **Optimal chunk size:** Balance latency vs efficiency

## ❓ Dependency FAQ

### "Why not use OpenAI's API directly?"
- **Privacy:** API sends your audio to their servers
- **Cost:** API charges per minute of audio
- **Offline:** API requires internet connection
- **Control:** Local models give you full control

### "Can I use different AI models?"
- **Whisper:** Stick with official OpenAI models (best accuracy)
- **Ollama:** Try different models for metadata generation
- **Custom:** Advanced users can modify the code

### "Why so many dependencies?"
- **Audio:** Cross-platform audio is complex
- **AI:** Modern AI models require substantial frameworks
- **Reliability:** Fallbacks and error handling need extra packages
- **Features:** Rich functionality requires specialized libraries

### "Is this bloated?"
- **Compared to cloud services:** Larger initial download, but then completely offline
- **Compared to professional tools:** Much smaller than Adobe Audition, etc.
- **Functionality:** Each package serves a specific, essential purpose

## 🔧 Alternative Configurations

### Minimal Setup (Transcription only)
```bash
pip install openai-whisper sounddevice scipy numpy python-dotenv
# ~300MB total, basic transcription with timestamp filenames
```

### Full Features (Without Ollama)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# All features except AI-generated filenames/summaries
# Uses ID_DATE_transcript.md format for files
```

### AI-Enhanced Setup (Recommended)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
brew install ollama  # or download from ollama.ai
ollama pull gemma3:4b
# Full features with smart filenames and summaries
```
